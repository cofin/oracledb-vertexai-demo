# Example Requirement: Add Product Recommendation Caching

> This is an example requirement folder. Delete this and create real requirements with `/plan`.

## Overview

This requirement demonstrates the structure for planning features using the Planner agent.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Requirement folder created in `specs/{requirement-slug}/`
- [ ] PRD written with technical details
- [ ] Tasks broken down with agent assignments
- [ ] Research conducted and documented
- [ ] Progress tracked in progress.md
- [ ] Recovery documentation enables work resumption

## Technical Design

### Data Model Changes

- Example: Add `recommendation_cache` table with TTL

### Service Layer

- Example: Implement `RecommendationService.get_cached_recommendations()`

### Integration Points

- Example: Oracle cache table, Vertex AI embeddings

## Dependencies

- Must complete before: Vector similarity search implementation
- Blocks: None
- External dependencies: None

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Cache invalidation complexity
  - Mitigation: Use simple TTL-based expiration initially

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for cache logic
- Integration tests with real Oracle database
- Performance tests for cache hit rate

## Documentation Updates

- Update `docs/guides/oracle-performance.md` with caching patterns
- Update `docs/guides/architecture.md` with cache layer

## Estimated Effort

**Complexity**: Medium
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
